        <h2> Respensive Design </h2>
        <p class="style"> This is an explanation of responsive design in html using css.</p>
        <a>A responsive web site is a site that's designed to adapt its layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries.

            You put it in whatever different devices you put it into and it should still display, the content should be the same,
             and the information conveyed should be the same.
            
            The 12-column grid layout, which is the most common and most convenient grid layout there is out there right now. 
            In order to achieve fluid width we actually use percentages to specify the width of each column and different items within the columns as well.
             We need to tell the devices out there that they should not try to zoom out and try to fit all the contents they can. 
             Instead they should behave as they are, mobile devices with more narrow screens and smaller screens, 
             and the way we would tell those devices all of this information is by using this meta tag, the viewport meta tag.

             <p> The most responsive framework uses a 12-grid layout.
                To have a 12-grid layout means that one cell in that grid has width 8.33% ie 100/12, next is (100/12)*2
                <"meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> Tells the browser to consider the width of the device as the real width of the screen and set its zoom level to 1, i.e., 100%, so it's not zoomed in or zoomed out.
                
             </p>
            </a>
